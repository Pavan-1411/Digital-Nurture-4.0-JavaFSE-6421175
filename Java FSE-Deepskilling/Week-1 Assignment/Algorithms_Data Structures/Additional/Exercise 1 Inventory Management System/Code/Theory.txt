Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

1)Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

In a store or inventory system with hundreds or thousands of products, efficient inventory management is essential.
It requires fast lookups by product ID, quick stock updates, accurate removal of discontinued items,
and minimal use of memory and processing time. Without suitable data structures and algorithms,
these operations can become slow, inefficient, and more prone to errors as the inventory grows.

2) Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

  Operation       HashMap  (Map<Integer, Product>)         ArrayList  (List<Product>)  
  -----------   ------------------------------------     -----------------------------  
   Add            O(1)                                    O(1)                             
   Search         O(1)                                    O(n)                             
   Update         O(1)                                    O(n)                             
   Delete         O(1)                                    O(n)                            

Since the complexities for HashMap are of O(1)[Amortized/Approximate] we are using HashMap for storing products.
 
3) Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.

in HashMap for add,search,update,del the Approximate time complexity id O(1).

4) Discuss how you can optimize these operations.
Using HashMap instead of ArrayList to avoid linear searches.
For ordered display, using LinkedHashMap (preserves insertion order).
