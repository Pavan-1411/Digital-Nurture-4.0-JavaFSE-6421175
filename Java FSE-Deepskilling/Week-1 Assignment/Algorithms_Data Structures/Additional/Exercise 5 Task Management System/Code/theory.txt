Exercise 5: Task Management System


1) Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

Singly Linked List: A linear data structure where each element called a node contains:

			-> data 

			-> a pointer to the next node in the list

structure:
	
	[ data | Next ] -> [ data | Next ] ->[ data | Next ] ->[ data | Next ] ->[ data | Next ] -> null

Node class: 
	
	class Node{
		int data;
		Node Next;
		Node(int data){
 			this.data = data;
			Next = null;
		}
	}


Doubly Linked List: It is also a linear data structure where each element called a node contains:
				
			-> data (of any type may be built in data types or user defined data types)

			-> a pointer to the next node in the list
			
			-> a pointer to the previous node in the list


structure:
	
	null <-> [ Prev | data | Next ] <-> [ Prev | data | Next ] <-> [ Prev | data | Next ] <-> [ Prev | data | Next ] <-> [ Prev | data | Next ] <-> null


Node class: 
	
	class Node{
		int data;
		Node Next;
		Node Prev;
		Node(int data){
 			this.data = data;
			Next = null;
			Prev = null;
		}
	}


Q) Analyze the time complexity of each operation.

Operation		Time Complexity

Insertion at Head	  O(1)		    Constant time
Insertion at End	  O(n)		    Traverse till last nod
Deletion		      O(n)		    finding the node which we want to delete takes O(n)
Search			      O(n)		    Linear search

Q) Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.

Dynamic Size Allocation - can grow or shrink at runtime as needed.
Efficient Insertions and Deletions- easy to insert/delete an element since no shifting is required like in the array.
No Need for Contiguous Memory-store elements in non-contiguous memory.
